Repository used for the Game Engine project in Game Engines

## Course Description

Students should be able to: 

- Design and implement a modern game engine using best practices of software engineering 
- Manage resources and memory in C++ efficiently 
- Create game engine modules with high cohesion and low coupling 
- Optimize performance bottlenecks on both the CPU and GPU 
- Generalize about the structure of, and similarities and differences between, modern 3d game engines  

The course objective is to give an overview of the technology that goes into game engines. The course is divided into several segments, each of which looks at one area of game technology. 

The focus of the course is on the foundations of game engine technology, not on the actual design and implementation of games. In addition, it is not primarily focused on using any specific engine or SDK (e.g. Unity or UDK), but instead on the underlying technical concepts. 

The course topics include: 
- Basics of game engines (why they exist, what they do) 
- Game engine design 
- 2D and 3D mathematics for games 
- Introduction to computer graphics (sprites, 3D meshes, scene, camera, lighting, etc.) 
- Introduction to collision detection and physics simulation (forces, collision, etc.) 
- Data structures and algorithms for game engines 
- Performance optimization 
- The role of scripting languages in engines 

The goal is for students to understand, and be able to analyze and implement the basics of, the major technological components of a modern game engine. In addition, since the general topic of game engines is so large, students will be able to choose which area they wish to understand in more depth, and work on a project in that area.
